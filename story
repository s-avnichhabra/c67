There once was a girl named Ella, but to make fun of her, her stepsisters called her cinderella. Since she was always covered in cinder. Then there was a ball and she wasn't allowed to go. So a fairy godmother showed up and fixed all her problems, until midnight at least. She came to the ball and met the prince when it was midnigh she ran like the wind. Next day prince came knocking to every door with the shoe she lost cause she was running so hard. Of course cinderella was tired from running so hard so she didn't answer the door. But the prince saw her anyway somehow so the shoe fit her and they lived happily ever after.
